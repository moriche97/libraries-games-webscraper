## Libraries games web scraper
The objective of this project is scrape the data of our libraries games from Steam and Epic Games, and compose a csv file with the duration and score of every game.

We can import this csv to an excel document and use the ordered list to planify to play the games and check them when completed.

### Usage of the tool
To use the tool, we have to complete prerequirements:
- Install node (recomended LTS version): [node releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
- Install Google Chrome: [Windows download page](https://www.google.com/intl/es_es/chrome/)
- Launch Google Chrome with debug port open: `chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222`
- Open this link on Chrome opened and copy "websocketDebuggerUrl" value: [localhost debug](http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version)
- Log in on Steam and Epic Games web pages as normally.
- Replace on `line 11` string value with "websocketDebuggerUrl" previously copied.
- Run `npm install` on project directory. 

After all preparations with Chrome still opened, type `npm run start` to launch the tool on this directory.

The output csv file will be created as `games-with-score-and-duration.csv` in this directory.
